To simplify the management of user permissions in `pg_hba.conf`, you can leverage PostgreSQL roles and groups. While `pg_hba.conf` itself does not directly support group-wise authentication, you can achieve similar functionality by creating PostgreSQL roles and assigning users to these roles. You can then manage permissions based on these roles.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create Roles in PostgreSQL:**

   First, create roles for each authentication method you want to manage. For example, you can create roles `pamuser`, `scramuser`, and `trustuser`.

   sql
   CREATE ROLE pamuser;
   CREATE ROLE scramuser;
   CREATE ROLE trustuser;
   

2. **Assign Users to Roles:**

   Add users to the respective roles. This step assigns users to the appropriate groups.

   sql
   GRANT pamuser TO hasib;
   GRANT scramuser TO nahid;
   GRANT trustuser TO zahid;
   

3. **Configure `pg_hba.conf`:**

   Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to use roles for authentication. This way, you only need to update the roles when adding or removing users, rather than modifying `pg_hba.conf` for each individual user.

   plaintext
   # Allow pamuser role to authenticate using PAM
   host    all             +pamuser        0.0.0.0/0               pam pamservice=pgpam

   # Allow scramuser role to authenticate using SCRAM-SHA-256
   host    all             +scramuser      0.0.0.0/0               scram-sha-256

   # Allow trustuser role to authenticate without a password
   host    all             +trustuser      0.0.0.0/0               trust
   

   Note: The `+` prefix before the role name indicates that the entry applies to all users who are members of the specified role.

4. **Edit `postgresql.conf` to Listen on All IP Addresses:**

   Open the `postgresql.conf` file:

  
   sudo nano /etc/postgresql/[version]/main/postgresql.conf
   

   Find and set the `listen_addresses` parameter:

   plaintext
   listen_addresses = '*'
   

5. **Restart PostgreSQL Service:**

   Restart the PostgreSQL service to apply the changes:

   sudo systemctl restart postgresql

6. **Configure Firewall to Allow PostgreSQL Connections (if applicable):**

   Ensure the PostgreSQL port (default 5432) is open in your firewall settings:

  
   sudo ufw allow 5432/tcp
   

### Summary

By using PostgreSQL roles and assigning users to these roles, you can simplify the management of user permissions in `pg_hba.conf`. This approach reduces the need to individually list each user in the `pg_hba.conf` file and makes it easier to manage user permissions in groups.
